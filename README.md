## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I'm trying to grasp better and further the mobile first approach and trying to learn the balance. That's being said I've got still difficulties but as I go further, things get clearer and easier.
